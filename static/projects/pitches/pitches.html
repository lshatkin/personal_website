    <span>In the Summer of 2016, I attended a study abroad program in Cape Town, South Africe where I took my first real leap into Data Science. At the end of the program, everyone in my class completed a hackathon, and my team and I created this Baseball Outcome Prediction tool. The MLB provided (and still provides) magnificent data that is easy to build projects on for beginners. </span>

    <span class="lb">This project allowed us to use all of our newly learned technologies of <b> R, Shiny, basic machine learning and data visualization. </b> Importantly, we also wrote a paper to detail out findings (see above), which is the first statistical paper I worked on. </span>
