    <span> This was my final project for my Advanced Artificial Intelligence course during my Master's program. I replicated a <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.07104.pdf>fake news detection paper </a> (discussed further below) by re-creating the model and all of the figures in the paper. This project helped me practice my skills with machine learning, and also introduced me to the importance of reproducability within machine learning. </span>

    <span><b><i> Abstract: </i></b> For the final project in EECS 692 at the University of Michigan, students were assigned to replicate a published paper and reproduce the results presented in that paper. For my replication project, I chose to replicate the paper titled <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.07104.pdf><i>Automatic Detection of Fake News</i></a>, originally authored by Veronica Perez-Rosas, Bennet Kleinberg, Alexandra Lefevre and Rada Mihalcea. The study, conducted at both the University of Michigan and the University of Amsterdam, aimed to create a model that could differentiate between fake news and non-fake news (more direct definitions to come). The original authors looked at several difference features across two datasets, and presented the accuracy of different features and combinations of features. In my project, I replicated this study by creating the same features as the original authors did and training a similar SVM. In this paper, I discuss the challenges with this process, as well as the successes as failures of my replication. </span>
