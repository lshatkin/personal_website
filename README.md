# Technology

Developed using Python Flask, and a lot of CSS and Jinja2.
Currently hosted on Heroku. 

Sidenote: I struggle to understand why web UI isn't as easy to make as Android's.

    <p class="text-title">About Me </p>
    <br/>
    <p class="text-description"> I am currently a Software Engineer at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. in Chicago, where I grew up. I recently (December 2019) graduated from a Master's program in Computer Science at the University of Michigan, where I focused on Artificial Intelligence. Through work, side projects, and articles (coming soon!), I hope to use my skills and interest in computer programming and artificial intelligence for meaningful purposes. I am well versed in the computer languages of Python (Pandas, Flask, scikit-learn, APIs, and more), C++, R, and SQL - and also in the process of learning Scala and Java. I am always looking for friends to work on projects with or simply talk shop, so reach out!
