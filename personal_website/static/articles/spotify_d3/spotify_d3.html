After a long battle with the folks over at Spotify, I was finally able to get my entire listening history on Spotify (well, at least from 2016 until now). This achievement also coincided with a newfound interest in D3.js, a JavaScript library with strong data visualization tools (thanks to Daniel for introducing me). So, I decided to dive head first into the weeds of D3, and I came out the other end with the following <b>interactive visualizations </b>. D3 was certainly a pain at some points, but I am extremely pleased with the end result, and excited to continue learning the intricacies of the library after this. 

<br><br>

As with my <a href = http://www.lloydshatkin.com/articles/spotify> other Spotify research article</a>, I know it is less exciting to see MY spotify listening history rather than yours. As I mentioned last time, if you want to get your data from Spotify - which is difficult but also just sending emails so not too arduous - I am happy to create these same analyses and visualizations for you. I hope you enjoy this small ineractive playground I created, and please reach out with any questions and comments!

First off, a helpful hint moving forward: zoom out a little on your screen to be able to see the graphics a little more easily, just to 80% or so. 
<br><br>
D3 provides a great framework for working with interactive hiearachies. I decided to start my article here, with a <b>zoomable sunburst</b> that displays genre hierarchies. The genres displayed are the genres provided by Spotify for the artists I listen to. Artists can be classified as several genres, so don't be surprised to see the same artist across different genres. For example, Kendrick Lamar is classified under the genres Rap, Hip Hop, Conscious Hip Hop and West Coast Hip Hop. I decided to leave an artist connected to all their genres because, as Spotify thinks as well, an artist is rarely tied down to one individual genre. Going back to the genre hierarchies, I created the hierarachy purely based on the name of the genre, meaning hardcore <i> hip hop </i> is a child of <i> hip hop</i>, indie <i> rock </i> is a child of <i> rock</i>, and so on. 
<br><br>
The basic layout of a zoomable sunburst is that once you click on a section, the sunburst opens up to the children of that section, and once you click on a child, the rest of the charts for that genre will appear. Additionally, the larger the section on the sunburst, the more artists of that genre I listened to. <b>If this is the first time opening this article for you, then here are simple instructions to get you familiar with how the sunburst works</b>:
<br><br>
<ol class = "content">
    <li>Click on the "hip hop" section of the sunburst, this will take you to the children of the hip hop genre.</li>
    <li>Click on the white circle in the middle of the donut, this will return you up a level.</li>
    <li>Click on the "hip hop" section of the sunburst again.</li>
    <li>Click on the "hip hop" section once more, this time the section will have a more faded orange color, indicating this section does not have any children.</li>
    <li>Off you go!</li>
</ol>

    The following interactive bar chart allows us to dig a little deeper into the top artists for this genre by
    showing us the top songs for each artist. Click the bar next to an artist's name to get to the top songs for
    that artist. <b> To return back to the list of artists, click the red box. </b>

    The following sequential sunburst helps illustrate the breakdown of music listening for a genre 
    across years, seasons, and days of week. Follow the following instructions to get you started:

    <br><br>
    <ol class = "content">
        <li>In the innermost ring, hover over the dark purple section. Above the chart, you should see a tag above the chart displaying "2017", and a percentage. This percentage represents the percent of total listens, for this genre, that occurred in 2017. Note that each color-coded section in the innermost ring represents a different year.</li>
        <li>Hover over the orange section above the purple section you just selected. The tags above show a new percentage that shows the percentage of total listens, for this genre, that occurred in the winter of 2017. Each color-coded section in this ring represents a different season. </li>
        <li>In the outermost ring, hover over the dark grey section. The last tag will now show "weekend", and the percentage will show what you expect. Note that the other section in this outer ring represents "weekday" listening.</li>
        <li>Finally, <b> and this one is important </b>, click any section on this sunburst and an explanation of what
        that section represents will appear to the right of the chart. This should be helpful for anyone who is still confused. </li>
        <li>Play around and look at all the different combinations across time. </li>

    The final interactive bar chart is similar to the one seen above, but just adds a few more features. In this bar
    chart, total listening is sectioned off by year and season, allowing you to easily see the top artist for the selected 
    genre in different sections of time, such as Winter 2019 or Fall 2017. As before with the interactive bar chart, <b> click on a bar to enter into that section, and click the red box to go back up a level </b>.

        Hopefully these charts provide an interesting and insightful look into the my music listening habits. Again, I know it would be more fun with your own data, so please reach out to Spotify and I can make one for you! Either way, have fun playing around in this interactive playground by choosing another genre and doing it all again. There is also one more chart at the conclusion of this worth checking out, after you get bored with the genres.

        I would like to end with a fun, visually appealing chart, similar to what I did in the <a href = http://www.lloydshatkin.com/articles/spotify#conclusion> first Spotify article</a>. This <b> chord dependency diagram</b> displays the artist crossover between different genres. A connection between two different genres means that there is at least one artist that is characterized as those two genres. Going back to the introduction paragraph, I said that Kendrick Lamar lies within the Rap and Hip Hop genres, so a link is thus created between those two genres. The width of the connection between two genres, aka the dependency chord, represents the amount of artists that hold those two genres. Looking at hip hop and rap, for example, we see a pretty large dependency chord, which makes sense considering the similarity of these two genres. 
        <br><br>
        I enjoyed seeing the crossover and diversity of certain genres, such as soul. The "soul" genre is connected to 8 other genres. In a way, this can be interpreted as soul music having an influence on a wide variety of genres. But, this graph is less for statsitical inferences and conclusions, and more just for fun. Enjoy, and see what you can find!
