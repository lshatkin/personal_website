After a long battle with the folks over at Spotify, I was finally able to get my entire listening history on Spotify (well, at least from 2016 until now). This achievement also coincided with a newfound interest in D3.js, a JavaScript library with strong data visualization tools (thanks to Daniel for introducing me). So, I decided to dive head first into the weeds of D3, and I came out the other end with the following <b>interactive visualizations </b>. D3 was certainly a pain at some points, but I am extremely pleased with the end result, and excited to continue learning the intricacies of the library after this. 

<br><br>

As with my <a href = http://www.lloydshatkin.com/articles/spotify> other Spotify research article</a>, I know it is less exciting to see MY spotify listening history rather than yours. As I mentioned last time, if you want to get your data from Spotify - which is difficult but also just sending emails so not too arduous - I am happy to create these same analyses and visualizations for you. I hope you enjoy this small ineractive playground I created, and please reach out with any questions and comments!

First off, a helpful hint moving forward: zoom out a little on your screen to be able to see the graphics a little more easily, just to 75% or so.

D3 provides a great framework for working with interactive hiearachies. I decided to start my article here, with a <b>zoomable sunburst</b> that displays genre hierarchies. The genres displayed are the genres provided by Spotify for the artists I listen to. Artists can be classified as several genres, so don't be surprised to see the same artist across different genres. Further, I created the hierarachy of genres purely based on the name of the genre, meaning hardcore <i> hip hop </i> is a child of <i> hip hop</i>, indie <i> rock </i> is a child of <i> rock</i>, and so on. 
<br><br>
The basic layout of a zoomable sunburst is that once you click on a section, the sunburst opens up to the children of that section, and once you click on a child, the rest of the charts for that genre will appear. <b>If this is the first time opening this article for you, then here are simple instructions to get you familiar with how the sunburst works</b>:
<br><br>
<ol class = "content">
    <li>Click on the "hip hop" section of the sunburst, this will take you to the children of the hip hop genre.</li>
    <li>Click on the white circle in the middle of the donut, this will return you up a level.</li>
    <li>Click on the "hip hop" section of the sunburst again.</li>
    <li>Click on the "hip hop" section once more, this time the section will have a more faded orange color, indicating this section does not have any children.</li>
    <li>Off you go!</li>
</ol>

    The following sequential sunburst helps illustrate the breakdown of music listening for a genre 
    across years, seasons, and days of week. Hover over any section and look above the chart to see
    the time characteristics selected and the percent of total listens for this genre that were during these
    time characteristics. The inner most ring allows you to select a certain year, the middle
    ring allows you to select a certain season, and the outermost ring allows you to select the option of 
    weekend or weekday.  <b> This may be a little confusing, so instead of
    just hovering over a section, click any section to display a helpful summary of what that section represents </b>.

    The final hierarchical bar chart allows you to investigate a little further the most popular artists
    and songs listened to during a certain year and season. All rankings are based on total songs listened to.
    Click on one of the bars the represents all the
    songs played in a given year, then click on a bar that represents all the songs played during that season 
    of the selected year. Here, your top artists of that year and season will be displayed. You can again click on an
    artist to see the most played songs of that artist. To return up a level, click on the top left corner, just to the
    left of the 0 marker.
