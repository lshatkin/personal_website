    <span>The wave of hype for cryptocurrencies and a lack of a centralized research dashboard led me to create this tool. I wanted to create an aggregator that simply found all the available resources around the web for a given coin, and put them in one place. I had never worked with APIs or Web Scraping tools before, so this project let me dip my tools in a couple new technologies. It uses the Shiny framework to display various information about different cryptocurrencies. </span>

    <span class="lb"> I used this project mainly to explore new technologies, focusing on the gathering of information from external sources. I gained firstime experience using <b> Web APIs and Selenium </b> There are a lot of missing pieces and unfinished ends, but I have used the knowledge I gained through this project countless times.</span>
