    <span class="lb">This was my final project for my NLP class during my Master's program. I worked with three classmates, and we created a caption generator and a valence shifting model. This project exposed me to data collection and storage techniques, as well as advanced NLP packages such as Stanfrod CoreNLP and spaCy. </span>

    
    <span> <b><i> Abstract: </i></b> When two different people attempt to describe
    the same exact image they may come up with
    two different descriptions. This does not mean
    that one of the people is necessarily wrong;

    however, it does hint at a difference in per-
    spective and an inherent bias that influences

    the way these two people interpret the image.
    Both peopleâ€™s objective description is likely
    true, but their subjective interpretation of the

    image may differ. This subjective bias is a nat-
    ural process in humans that we frequently par-
    ticipate in without being aware of it. However,

    even though this process is automatic for hu-
    mans, it is difficult for a machine to inject bias

    into its image understanding in the same way.
    This is the problem our team set out to solve
    through this project by creating a system that
    is able to generate a caption for an image with
    a subjective bias.</span>
