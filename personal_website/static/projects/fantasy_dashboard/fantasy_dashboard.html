    <span>This is my first website I built, inspired by my desire for easy access to advanced and historical statistics for my fantasy football league. I have been in a fantasy football league since early high school, and I wanted to see everyones lifetime record, how many championships they had, and so on. This could easily be done by just pulling data and running some calculations, but I wanted my friends to be able to easily see this info as well, so I created the sight!</span>

    <span class="lb">Additionally, I was able to learn some great new technologies along the way. Other than class projects, this is the first time I used <b>Flask, AWS, shell scripts, and cron jobs.</b> Further, while I had used these technologies before, this was my first full project using Python and SQL. </span>

    <span> This project started in the NFL season of 2019. I plan to continue to add features, including some advanced analytics as I initially wanted. </span>
